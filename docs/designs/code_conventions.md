# Code Conventions

Key principles and conventions to follow when writing code:

## File/folder conventions

- Filenames should be in lower snake case (e.g. `file_name.ts`)
- Folder/file structure should be as flat as possible
- Don't use `index.ts` files unless necessary
- All ts/js files should have a license header
